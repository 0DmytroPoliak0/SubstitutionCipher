# SubstitutionCipher
A simple C++ implementation of a substitution cipher with encryption and decryption functionalities. This project demonstrates the use of maps for character-to-number and number-to-character conversions.


## Features
- **Encrypt**: Convert plaintext to ciphertext by replacing each character with its corresponding number.
- **Decrypt**: Convert ciphertext back to plaintext by replacing each number with its corresponding character.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that only valid alphabetic characters are processed for encryption and valid numeric sequences are processed for decryption.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error handling for invalid inputs.
